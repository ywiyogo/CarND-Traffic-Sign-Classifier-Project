## About this repository
This repository contains a Ipython notebook project that shows how a traffic sign recognition works. The algorithm works based on the Computer Vision algorithms. It runs offline and not in real-time. I use the deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. 

The training and validation datasets to classify traffic sign images comes from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Requirements

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.

2. Install the Udacity starting kit from [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit).

## Installation

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ywiyogo/CarND1-P5-VehicleDetection.git

## Usage

1. Go to the repository folder 

        cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project

    and activate the virtualenvironment:

        source activate carnd-term1

2. Start the program 

        jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
